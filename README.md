## Backend Code requirements

### Style

* Obey [django's style guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/#model-style).
* Configure your IDE to use [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) for checking your python code. For running flake8 manualy, do `cd src && flake8`
* Prefer English over your native language in comments and commit messages.
* Commit messages should contain the unique id of issue they are linked to (refs #100500)
* Every model and a model method should have a docstring.

### Code organisation

* KISS and DRY.
* Obey [django best practices](http://django-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* If you want to implement some business logic â€” make a service for that. Service examples: [UserCreator](https://github.com/f213/education-backend/blob/master/src/users/creator.py#L21), [OrderCreator](https://github.com/f213/education-backend/blob/master/src/orders/creator.py#L19)
* **No logic is allowed within the views or templates**. Only services and models.
* Use PEP-484 [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) when possible.
* Prefer [Manager](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/db/managers/) methods over static methods.
* Do not use [signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/signals/) for business logic. Signals are good only for notification purposes.
* No l10n is allowed in python code, use [django translation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/i18n/translation/).
